# Brand Assets

This directory contains the brand assets for the BoilerJuice integration.

## Required Files

1. `icon.png`: Square icon (256x256 pixels)

   - Used in the integrations page
   - Should be a simple, recognizable symbol
   - Preferably with a transparent background

2. `logo.png`: Rectangular logo (256x256 pixels)
   - Used in the configuration flow
   - Can be more detailed than the icon
   - Can include the BoilerJuice text logo
   - Preferably with a transparent background

## Guidelines

- Use PNG format with transparency
- Keep file sizes small (optimize the images)
- Use the official BoilerJuice brand colors where possible
- Make sure the icons are clearly visible on both light and dark themes
